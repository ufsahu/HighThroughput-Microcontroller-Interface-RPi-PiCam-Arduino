# PiCamUsage
My Master's Thesis was Developing a High-Throughput System for Monitoring Zebrafish Animal Behaviour.
The system was based on a Microcontroller Interface Setup, using a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller (PiBoard Microcontroller RPi Zero W V1.1), the PiCam camera counterpart  (PiCam V2.1), and Arduino Uno R3.
The system was synced with a white LED Planar Light Source providing different lighting protocols programmed in the Arduino.
The lighting protocols consisted of a few seconds of darkness and then a few seconds of light stimuli. These protocols were developed simply by improvising the Arduino C script. Having a variety of lighting protocols allowed us to analyze the neurological behaviours and responses of the animal model towards those light stimuli. 
The time for light and dark frames was taken from the literature review. 
Following is the basic pipeline of the entire High-Throughput System:
